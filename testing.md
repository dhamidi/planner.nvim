## Testing Plan Based on publish.md Analysis

### Research Results

The publish.md file contains a comprehensive specification for preparing a Neovim plugin for publishing, including detailed mini.test framework implementation with concrete test files, GitHub Actions workflow, and quality assurance guidelines.

### Critical Test Cases (5 Essential Tests)

1. **Plugin Setup and Initialization Test** - DONE

2. **Core Functionality Test - Text Processing** - DONE

3. **File I/O Operations Test**
   - Test logging functionality to `~/.planner.log`
   - Verify response file handling at `~/.planner.response`
   - Test error handling when files can't be written/read

4. **External Dependency Integration Test**
   - Test amp CLI tool availability and execution
   - Verify proper error handling when amp CLI is missing
   - Test process spawning with `vim.loop` and async operations

5. **Plugin Manager Compatibility Test**
   - Test installation with lazy.nvim structure
   - Verify plugin loads correctly in different plugin managers
   - Test that required directories (lua/planner/, plugin/) exist and work

### Additional Quality Assurance Tests

6. **Buffer State Management Test**
   - Test visual mode selection handling (v, V, ctrl-v)
   - Verify cursor position preservation after processing
   - Test undo/redo functionality after text replacement

7. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - Test behavior with empty selection
   - Test network/CLI timeout scenarios
   - Test malformed response handling
